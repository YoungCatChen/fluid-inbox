# Fluid userscript for Google Inbox

Google Inbox comes with a brand new experience for email tracking and reading,
but I just don’t want to open a browser just for checking emails.
Inspired by this post
[Running Google Inbox as a Mac App](https://medium.com/aarons-blog/running-google-inbox-as-a-mac-app-6ae1be7613c4),
I wrote this userscript that enables dock badge and notifications.

## Features

- Dock badge:
  - Shows when there are unread thread(s).
  - Tells how many threads are unread.
- Notification:
  - Displays via OS X’s Notification center when there are new unread thread(s).
  - Tells the sender.

A screen shot is on the way.

## Future plan

- Play a sound on new email.
